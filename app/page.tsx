            I am a Year 1 Computer Science student at the National University of Singapore (NUS)
            and a tuition teacher. Physics is my favourite subject to teach.
            <br />
            <br />
            This website exists because, unlike O-Level Physics, H2 Physics does not have a single,
            well-structured textbook. Many students struggle to find clear and coherent notes.
            My goal is to build a place with structured, student-friendly explanations for my own
            students and other H2 Physics learners.
            <br />
            <br />
            The site is still under development. In the long run, I hope to include all H2 Physics
            chapters, practice questions, and interactive simulations to help build real intuition.
